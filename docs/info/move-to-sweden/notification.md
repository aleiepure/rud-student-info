# Notification of moving to Sweden

Once you arrive in Sweden and have your [Freja eID](/docs/info/move-to-sweden/freja), you need to notify
[*Skatteverket* (Swedish Tax Agency)](https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/englishengelska.4.12815e4f14a62bc048f4edc.html)
about your move. They are responsible for registering people in Sweden and issuing the *personnummer* (personal identity
number). The registration process is free of charge and requires 4-6 weeks to be completed.

It is important to notify *Skatteverket* as soon as possible after your arrival in Sweden, as the *personnummer* is required
for almost everything and the process can take a while.

Additional information can be found on the [official page](https://www7.skatteverket.se/portal/flytta-till-sverige/fts).

## Steps

The process is divided into two steps:

1. **Online notification**: You need to fill in an online form no earlier than two weeks prior to your arrival in the country.
2. To access the form, log in with your [Freja eID](/docs/info/move-to-sweden/freja). You can find the form on the [official website](https://www7.skatteverket.se/portal/flytta-till-sverige/fts). Based on the information you provide, the form will tell you which documents
3. you need to provide and upload as part of the process. If you have issues with the online form, you will get help during
4. your in-person visit (see below), but the process might be delayed.

5. **In-person visit**: After submitting the online form, book an appointment at their [nearest office](https://www.statenssc.se/en/visit-a-service-centre/karlstad-service-centre). Bring all the documents you were asked to provide during the online notification step. During
6. the appointment, they will verify your identity and documents, take a picture of you, and scan your passport.

## After the appointment

After 4-6 weeks, you will receive a letter with several papers at your registered address. One of the papers titled *Folkbokföring
Registerutdrag* (Extract of the Population Registration) lists your personal information according to their records. The
other paper, titled *Beslut Folkbokföringsärende* (Decision on Population Registration Matter), explains the decision
about your registration and how to appeal it if you think it is wrong. Keep both papers, as you might need them in the
future.

## Your information is public

After you get assigned your *personnummer*, your basic information (name, address, *personnummer*, date of birth, marital
status, citizenship, etc.) becomes public.

Any private person and/or company can request this information from *Skatteverket* by phoning them or visiting one of their
offices. In addition, it can be accessed by anyone via several websites such as [ratsit.se](https://www.ratsit.se/),
[hitta.se](https://www.hitta.se/), [mr koll](https://mrkoll.se/), and many others. This is standard practice in Sweden
and is used for various purposes, including credit checks and background verifications.

If you want your information to be taken down, you need to contact each website individually and request the removal. They
are not required to comply to your request and might just ignore it. If you manage to get it taken down, you might face
issues in the future when applying for jobs, renting an apartment, or other activities that require a credit check or
background verification. Regardless, your information will still be available through *Skatteverket* and other official
channels.
