# Freja eID

The first step to get [registered in Sweden](/docs/info/move-to-sweden/notification) is to get a Freja eID. This is a mobile app you can download on your phone and use to prove your [identity online](/docs/info/daily-life/e-identity).

The registration process is straightforward, but it may take some time depending on how busy the Swedish authorities are. You’ll need to take a picture of your passport and a selfie video, so make sure you have a good internet connection and a well-lit environment.

You can find more information about the process on the [official website](https://frejaeid.com/en/registration/).

:::tip
Freja eID and Freja eID+ are not the same thing. As an unregistered person in Sweden, you can only get the basic Freja eID. Once you get your *personnummer*, you need to reregister to get Freja eID+. More on this [here](/docs/info/daily-life/e-identity#freja-eid).
