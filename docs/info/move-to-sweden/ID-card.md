# Skatteverket ID-Kort (ID Card)

Now that you have your *personnummer* (personal identity number), you will need a valid ID to prove your identity in Sweden. While citizens get theirs from the Police, non-citizens get theirs from *Skatteverket* (Swedish Tax Agency), called *Skatteverket ID-Kort*. Make sure to get one so you can prove your identity when needed without having to carry your passport around.

More information can be found on the [official page](https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/englishengelska/individualsandemployees/livinginsweden/swedishtaxagencyidentitycards.4.7da1d2e118be03f8e4f30bb.html).

## Request Process

The ID card costs 400 SEK and requires 1-2 weeks to be ready.

1. **Pay the fee**: Pay the 400 SEK fee by making a bank transfer to the following account: IBAN SE55 1200 0000 0128 1012 1613; Swift/BIC DABASESX.

2. **Book an appointment**: Book an appointment to request the ID card. You can find the [booking system here](https://www.statenssc.se/en/visit-a-service-centre/karlstad-service-centre). Make sure to allow enough time for the payment to be processed before your appointment, as they will check for it during the appointment.

3. **Bring the required documents**: Go to your appointment with the following documents:
   - Your passport
   - The receipt of your payment (print it in case they cannot find it in their system; they will scan it and attach it to your application)
   - Your *personnummer* (you can show the letter you received from *Skatteverket* or just memorize it)

4. **During the appointment**: They will verify your identity and documents, measure your height, take a picture of you, and scan your passport. At the end, you will receive a receipt of the application.
6. **After the appointment**: After 1-2 weeks, you will receive two colored cards at your registered address. They open by tearing off the edges. The black one informs you that the card is ready and can be picked up at the office. The blue one contains the unlock code for the digital eID function of the card. Make sure to keep it safe; if you lose it, you need to request a new card.
7. **Pick up your card**: Go to the same office where you had your appointment and bring the receipt you received during the appointment. No appointment is needed this time. They will give you your card, ask you to sign it on the back, and print out another receipt.
