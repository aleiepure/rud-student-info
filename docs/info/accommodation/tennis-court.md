# Tennis Court and Table Tennis Room

## Tennis Court

Located outside towards the back of the park area, the tennis court is available for use by all residents. There doesn’t seem to be a booking system, so it’s likely first-come, first-served.

## Table Tennis Room

The table tennis room is located in Horsensgatan 8. To access it, you need to get the keys from the office at Horsensgatan 2. For more about keys and access, see the [rent page](/docs/info/accommodation/rent). Office hours are:

- Tuesdays: 10:30 - 12:00 and 17:00 - 18:00 (in August only in the morning)
- Thursdays: 10:30 - 12:00
