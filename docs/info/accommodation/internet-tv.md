# Internet & TV providers

In the apartments located in Horsensgatan and Fadderortsgatan, you have two options for internet and TV providers: Tele2 (coax) and Telia (fiber). You can choose to subscribe to one of them or use your mobile data plan. For details about rent and what’s included, see the [rent page](/docs/info/accommodation/rent).

## Tele2

Tele2 provides internet through a coaxial cable connection. You can find more information about their plans and pricing on their [official website](https://www.tele2.se/privat/bredband/).

## Telia

Telia offers internet via fiber optic connections. The real estate agency has negotiated a package for all the apartments in Horsensgatan and Fadderortsgatan, which includes 150/150 Mbps internet and the basic TV package (streamed via the Telia Play app) for 399 SEK/month with a binding period of 12 months. You can use your own router instead of buying theirs for 999 SEK; there are cheaper options available.

To open an account with Telia, visit their store in person at Bergvik shopping mall (Bergviksvägen 1, 653 43 Karlstad). Bring your ID (passport or national ID card) and your rental contract. If you open the account before having a Swedish personal identity number (*personnummer*), you’ll need to visit again once the service is active to enable the TV package. Once you get your *personnummer*, provide it to Telia so you can access your personal page on their website after setting up [bankID](/docs/info/daily-life/e-identity).

:::tip
The internet connection enters your apartment in the box located in the hallway next to the bathroom door. To connect your router via the box near the window in the main room, you’ll need an additional ethernet cable. Use it to connect the two ethernet plugs on the hallway box to enable the internet connection in the main room.
