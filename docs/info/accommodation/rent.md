# Rent

The rent for the apartments located in Horsensgatan and Fadderortsgatan needs to be paid in advance every month. The rent
includes heating, water, and electricity. The apartments are furnished, and two internet providers are available: Tele2
(coax) and Telia (fiber). You can choose to subscribe to one of them ([see Internet & TV providers](/docs/info/accommodation/internet-tv)),
or use your mobile data plan.

## Payment

Unless you have a [Swedish bank account](/docs/info/daily-life/banks.md) with an automatic payment, you will need to do
a bank transfer to the following account each month:

Recipient: Stiftelsen Karlstads Studentbostäder
Address: Sågverksgatan 249B, 652 21 Karlstad
IBAN: SE58 9500 0099 6026 1861 8728
BIC/SWIFT: NDEASESS
Reference/description/message: the OCR code on your invoice (top right corner, OCR-nr/meddelande) 
```

Make sure to include the OCR code in the payment, otherwise your payment might not be processed correctly.

Double-check the IBAN on the invoices. I am not responsible if the information is outdated or incorrect and you lose money.

## Din Hyresvärd

In the September 2025 invoice, you should have received a code to register on the [Din Hyresvärd](https://www.dinhyresvard.se/)
website. This is the platform used to manage your rental contract and invoices. You can use it to:

- View, download and check the payment status of your invoices
- Update your contact information
- Download the rental contract
- Download the notice to move out (3 months notice required)

## Maintenance Issues

If you encounter any maintenance issues in your apartment or need new nameplates (mailbox and door), you can send an email
to `felanmalan@egeryds.se` with a description of the issue and, if possible, pictures.

For problems with the contract, invoices, moving in/out, and keys, you can contact `info@egeryds.se`.

## Entrance & Intercom

The main entrance to the building is secured with an electronic lock. You can unlock it using any of the three tags you
received with the keys. If you have visitors, they can use the intercom next to the entrance door to call you on your
mobile phone. It requires a Swedish phone number, so make sure to update your contact information on
[Din Hyresvärd](https://www.dinhyresvard.se/) once you get one and send an email to `info@egeryds.se`.

:::tip
The main door is equipped with an automatic opening mechanism. To activate it, press the grey panels located below the
intercom outside or on the inside wall next to the door. The door will open automatically and close itself after a while.
