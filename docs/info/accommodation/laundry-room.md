# Laundry Room

The laundry room is located on the ground floor of the building. You can access it using one of the three tags you received with the keys. The laundry room is equipped with two washing machines, one tumble dryer, one drying cabinet, and an ironing machine (roller). Instructions for operating the machines are visible on the panels inside the laundry room (only in Swedish). For washers and dryers with interactive menus, you can set the language to English by selecting *Språk* (language).

Using the machines is free of charge. You need to bring your own laundry detergent, fabric softener, and other laundry supplies.

## Booking

To use the laundry room, you need to book a time slot in advance. Slots are five hours long (7:00 - 12:00, 12:00 - 17:00, 17:00 - 22:00), and you are allowed ten bookings per month. There are several ways to book a slot:

### Info panel

In the main entrance of the building, there is an info panel on the wall next to the mailboxes. You can use it to book a slot by following the instructions on the screen. After logging in with one of the three tags you received with the keys, you can see the available slots and select one.

### Website

You can also book a slot using the [web interface (Swedish only)](https://rud-web.hsbvarmland.se:8050/M5WebBokning/). This website works best on a computer and mirrors the info panel in the building.

The credentials to log in are:

```text
Username (case sensitive): LGH XXXX / YYYY
Password: 1234
```

Where `XXXX` is your short apartment number (add a zero in front e.g., 0311) and `YYYY` is the long apartment number (e.g. 1102).

:::important
Note that there are spaces in the username after `LGH` and around `/`.

After logging in, you can select which screen to use (your address or [Horsensgatan 4 (bastu)](/docs/info/accommodation/sauna.md)). Selecting your address, you can then choose "*boka*" (book) to see the available laundry rooms and their respective available slots.

### Mobile app

The website is also available as a mobile app. Unfortunately, the system is quite old and the app is not available in the app stores anymore. For Android, it is still possible to download the installation file (APK) from [here](https://d.apkpure.com/b/APK/com.electrolux.visionmobile?version=latest) (you might need to enable installation from unknown sources).

To login with the app, use the same credentials as for the website (see above) or after logging in the website click "*Använd mobilen för att boka*" (use the mobile to book) at the bottom to generate a QR code that you can scan with the app to log in.

The app is available in both Swedish and English.
