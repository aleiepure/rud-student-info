# Home Insurance

When renting an apartment in Sweden, it is highly recommended to have home insurance (*hemförsäkring*). This insurance typically covers damages to your personal belongings, liability for damages you may cause to others, and sometimes even travel insurance.

You can choose from various insurance providers, such as Länsförsäkringar, Folksam, Trygg-Hansa and many others. The cost of home insurance can vary depending on the coverage you choose and the provider.

Home insurance is per household and not per person, so if you are sharing the apartment with somebody, you can split the cost and get the same coverage.
