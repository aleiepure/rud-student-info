# Home Insurance

When renting an apartment in Sweden, it is highly recommended to have home insurance (*hemförsäkring*). This insurance typically covers damages to your personal belongings, liability for damages you may cause to others, and sometimes even travel insurance.

You can choose from various insurance providers, such as Länsförsäkringar, Folksam, Trygg-Hansa and many others. The cost of home insurance can vary depending on the coverage you choose and the provider.

Home insurance is per household and not per person, so if you are sharing the apartment with somebody, you can split the cost and get the same coverage.

The cheapest option I could find is Länsförsäkringar. They offer a student package (*student/ungdom*) starting from 50 SEK/month that includes coverage for:

- theft and damages
- fire and explosions
- water damage
- lightning and power surges
- flooding and natural disasters
- damages to appliances
- food spoilage in case of issues with your fridge/freezer
- incidents in traffic
- incidents with wildlife
- liability for damages you may cause to others
- therapy sessions in case of trauma
- help and support in case of a identity theft
- travel insurance (45 days per trip)
- bike insurance

:::danger Important: Don't Let Invoices Expire
In Sweden, failing to pay an invoice by its due date can have serious consequences that escalate quickly. Once the due date passes, companies will typically charge you a reminder fee (*påminnelseavgift*) plus penalty interest calculated from the original due date. Keep in mind that companies are not legally required to send you a reminder. It's your responsibility to track payment deadlines.

If the invoice remains unpaid after a reminder (if one was sent), the case gets handed to a debt collection agency (*inkasso*), which adds their own fees on top of what you already owe. In some cases, companies skip the *inkasso* step and send the case directly to Kronofogden (the Swedish Enforcement Authority). If you fail to dispute or pay Kronofogden's payment order within the specified timeframe, you'll receive a "*betalningsanmärkning*" (payment remark or "black mark") on your credit record.

This black mark stays on your record for three years and will severely impact your daily life. It will prevent you from getting phone contracts, obtaining credit cards or loans, and renting cars or accommodations (including keeping current ones). If you're planning to stay in Sweden long-term, a *betalningsanmärkning* can also negatively affect visa renewals, citizenship applications, and many other essential activities.
