# Sauna

There is a sauna (*bastu*) available for all residents located at Horsensgatan 4. You can access it by booking through the info panel in the building's main entrance, the website, or the mobile app (see [laundry room](/docs/info/accommodation/laundry-room) for more details on how to book). 

The sauna can be booked in the following time slots:

- 08:00 - 10:00
- 11:00 - 13:00
- 14:00 - 17:30
- 18:30 - 22:00

The heating starts 30 minutes before the booked time and stops at the end. Cleaning the sauna after use is mandatory; cleaning supplies are inside a closet.
