# Recycling

In Sweden, recycling is taken very seriously, and there are specific guidelines on how to sort and dispose of waste. When you sign your rental contract, you should receive a recycling guide in English that explains how to sort your waste.

On the ground floor of each building or outside, there are bins for sorted waste. Inside the waste room, you will also find free paper bags for food waste (*matavfall*). Take them whenever you need.

## Types of waste

Generally, you have to sort your waste into the following categories:

- **Food waste (*matavfall*)**: This includes all organic waste such as food scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags, and small amounts of dirty paper towels or napkins. Use the provided paper bags to collect food waste and dispose of them in the designated bin.
- **Metal packaging (*metallförpackningar*)**: This includes cans, foil, and other metal packaging. Rinse them out and place them in the designated bin for metal packaging. Place the items loosely in the bin, do not use bags.
- **Plastic packaging (*plastförpackningar*)**: This includes plastic bottles, containers, and packaging. Rinse them out and place them in the designated bin for plastic packaging. Place the items loosely in the bin, do not use bags.
- **Paper packaging (*pappersförpackningar*)**: This includes cardboard boxes, paper bags, and other paper packaging. Flatten boxes to save space and place them in the designated bin for paper packaging. Place the items loosely in the bin, do not use bags.
- **Printed materials (*tidningar*)**: This includes magazines, newspapers, and other printed materials. Place them in the designated bin for printed materials. Place the items loosely in the bin, do not use bags.
- **Colored/uncolored glass (*färgat/ofärgat glas*)**: This includes glass bottles and jars. Rinse them out and place them in the designated bin for glass packaging. Make sure to separate colored glass from uncolored glass. Place the items loosely in the bin, do not use bags.
- **Residual waste (*restavfall*)**: This includes all other waste that cannot be recycled, such as diapers, sanitary products, and broken items. Place this waste in the designated bin for residual waste. This bin is usually for non-recyclable waste only, so make sure to sort everything else correctly. You can use any type of plastic bag to collect this waste.

:::note
Cooking oil and grease should never be poured down the drain as it can cause blockages in the plumbing system. Instead,
collect them in a sealable container (plastic or glass) and place it in the residual waste bin.

:::tip
When buying drinks in plastic bottles or cans, you will get charged 2 SEK per item as a deposit (*pant*). When you return the empty bottles or cans to a recycling machine (found in most supermarkets), you will get a receipt that you can use to redeem the deposit at the checkout.
Bottles and cans need to be marked with a *pant* symbol and the machine needs to be able to read the barcode (make sure it's not crushed).

If you’re unsure where to dispose of an item, check the recycling guide you received, look for instructions on the packaging ("*sorteras som .../återvin som ...*"), or use the "Kasta rätt" app (see [useful apps](/docs/info/daily-life/useful-apps)). The app is available in both Swedish and English.

## Hazardous waste and other items

Hazardous waste such as batteries, electronics, paint, and chemicals should not be disposed of in regular bins. Instead, take them to any recycling center. Find the nearest collection point on the [Karlstad Energi website](https://karlstadsenergi.se/atervinning/atervinningscentraler).

## Missing bins in the waste room

Karlstad Energi, the company responsible for waste management in Karlstad, is currently changing how people sort their waste. Previously, only food waste and residual waste bins were available in or outside the buildings, and recyclable packaging needed to be taken to dedicated recycling stations (*återvinningsstationer*) around the city. By March 2026, all types of waste will be sorted and disposed of in the waste room of each building. If your building’s waste room doesn’t have all the bins yet, you can still use the recycling stations or look for outside bins nearby. There is one located near the [tennis court](/docs/info/accommodation/tennis-court) that has all bin types.
