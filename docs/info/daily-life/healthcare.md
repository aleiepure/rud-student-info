# Healthcare

Healthcare in Sweden is handled by the public healthcare system, which is funded through taxes. As a resident of Sweden, you are entitled to access healthcare services, including visits to doctors, specialists, and hospitals.

## Vårdcentral (Health Center)

The first point of contact for non-emergency healthcare is the *vårdcentral* (health center). Each area has its own *vårdcentral*, and you are
assigned to one based on your registered address. The closest *vårdcentral* to Rud is located near Pekås.

These centers provide a range of services, including general medical consultations, vaccinations, and minor treatments. To visit a *vårdcentral*, you usually need to make an appointment in advance. You can do this by calling them or using their online booking system after logging in via [e-identity](/docs/info/daily-life/e-identity).

When you visit a *vårdcentral*, remember to bring your Skatteverket ID.

## Emergency Care

In case of a medical emergency, you should visit the nearest emergency room (*akutmottagning*). The closest one to Rud is at the Karlstad Central Hospital (*Centralsjukhuset*). For life-threatening emergencies, call **112** for immediate assistance. The service is available 24/7, and operators can assist you in multiple languages, including English.

## Costs

Healthcare in Sweden is not free, but the costs are subsidized by the government. You will typically pay a small fee for visits to the *vårdcentral* or emergency room, with a maximum annual cap on healthcare costs. Once you reach this cap, further healthcare services within that year will be free of charge.

The same applies to prescription medications, which also have a maximum annual cost cap after which they are free of charge.

Dental care is not included in the public healthcare system. You need to register with *Försäkringskassan* for dental coverage. They are the Swedish Social Insurance Agency that manages various social benefits, including dental care subsidies. You can find more information on their [official website](https://www.forsakringskassan.se/english).
