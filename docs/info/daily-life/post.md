# Postal services

Sweden has a reliable postal service operated by PostNord. You can send and receive letters and packages both domestically 
and internationally.

## Address format

When providing your address, make sure to include the following information in this order:

```text
Your Name
Street Name and Number
Postal Code and City
Country
```

for example:

```text
John Doe
Horsensgatan 26 lgh 1101
65467 Karlstad
Sweden
```

For the appartment number (*lägenhetsnummer*), you can use either the long numeber (e.g., *lgh 1101*), the short one (e.g., *lgh 310*)
or both (e.g., *lgh 1101/310*, the order does not matter).

## Receiving mail

Mail is delivered to your mailbox every other day, except on weekends and public holidays. Make sure to check your mailbox
regularly when expecting mail.
Large packages, depending on the sender, are either delivered to your mailbox (left above or below), brought to your doorstep
(placed in the holder next to your door), or delivered to the nearest service point.

:::note
Service points are assigned based on the postal code of your address. You cannot freely choose one. Always use your full
home address when ordering something. The nearest PostNord service point is "Rud post och spel" located inside
the Pekås supermarket.

Download the [PostNord app](https://www.postnord.se/en/customer-service/postnord-app) to track your packages and get
notifications when you receive mail or packages. You can also use the app to manage your deliveries, such as changing
the delivery address or see the opening times for a service point.
The app is available in both Swedish and English and allows you to pickup parcels without ID if you verify your identity
using BankID (see [e-identity](/docs/info/daily-life/e-identity)).

## Sending mail

You can send letters and packages from any post office, service point or sending mailbox. The nearest post office is located
inside the Pekås supermarket.
Stamps are purchased online via the PostNord app or website, or at the post office/service point. You can also buy them
at some convenience stores and supermarkets. The service points also sell boxes and packaging materials.

## Other currier services

Other currier services, such as DHL, UPS, and FedEx, are also available in Sweden. They usually have their own service
points or partner with local stores for package drop-off and pickup. Check their respective websites for more information
on locations and services.

## Digital Mailbox

Some official letters from government agencies can be sent to a digital mailbox instead of your physical address. Additionally,
you can also choose to receive letters from private companies in your digital mailbox. This is a convenient way to manage
your mail online.

You can register for a digital mailbox via [Min Myndighetspost (swedish only)](https://minmyndighetspost.se/2.fe04f2018f19befcb967572.html)
for government letters or another private service like [Kivra](https://www.kivra.se/) or [Billo](https://billo.life/) for
all types of mail.
