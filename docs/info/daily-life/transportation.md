## Biking

Karlstad is a bike-friendly city with many dedicated bike lanes and paths. In the winter, when it snows, they even have
the priority to clear the bike lanes first, making it easier for cyclists to get around. In the city center, there are
many bike stores that sell new and used bikes, as well as offer repair services. For used bikes you can also check
online marketplaces ([see useful links](/docs/info/daily-life/useful-apps)).

Throughout the city, you will also find air pumps to inflate your bike tires. They are usually located near bike racks
or in parks. Around the university campus there are 2 air pumps, one near the main entrance of the university
and another one on the sidewalk next to Pressbyrån. For more information about biking in Karlstad, see the
[Karlstad Municipality's biking page (swedish only)](https://karlstad.se/trafik-och-gator/gator/cykla-och-ga/cykla-i-karlstad).

At the train station and the bus terminal, there are also bike rental services available if you need a bike for a short
period. For more information about bike rentals, see the [Värmlandstrafik website (swedish only)](https://www.varmlandstrafik.se/varmlandstrafik/res-med-oss/fler-resesatt/lanecykel).

Make sure to follow local traffic rules and regulations when using bikes, including wearing a helmet and not riding on sidewalks.

## Busses

Karlstad has an extensive bus network operated by Värmlandstrafik. You can use the buses to get around the city and
to nearby towns. Tickets can be purchased via the Värmlandstrafik app (see [useful apps](/docs/info/daily-life/useful-apps)),
by loading up a travel card at ticket machines or Pressbyrån stores, or directly from the bus driver (swish or card only).

The lines that are most useful getting to and from the area are:

- Line `3` from the bus stops "Rud Centrum" or "Fadderortsgatan" to go to/from the city center.
- Line `S` from the bus stop "Norrakyrkogården" to go to/from the university campus.

All city busses stop at Stora Torget in the city center, which is the main hub for busses in Karlstad.

Regional busses as well as international busses (e.g., to Oslo or Stockholm) depart from the bus terminal located in Drottninggatan,
a 10-minute walk from Stora Torget.
