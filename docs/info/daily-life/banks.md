# Banks

Sweden has become a largely cashless society, with most (if not all) transactions being done electronically. To get around you need a bank account either here or in your home country. If you plan to stay in Sweden for a longer period, it is recommended to open a Swedish bank account so you can easily pay rent, bills, and other expenses and not incur in transaction fees due to
currency conversion.

## Opening a Bank Account

Each bank has its own requirements and procedures to open an account. Generally, you will need:

- Skatteverket's ID card (see [ID Card](/docs/info/move-to-sweden/id-card))
- Your passport or national ID card
- Your Swedish personal identity number (*personnummer*)
- Proof of enrollment from the university (notification letter from [antagning.se](https://www.antagning.se/) or [universityadmissions.com](https://www.universityadmissions.com/), same website different language)

Some banks may also require additional documents based on your specific situation and citizenship.

:::important
You **do not** need to open a bank account at the bank in Arvika. They come during the orientation week to provide some general information. The university has not negotiated any special conditions with them.

Choose any bank you prefer.

:::note
Most banks have limited opening hours and some are not open at all without an appointment. It is recommended to check their websites for more information and book an appointment if needed.
