# e-Identity

In Sweden, most online services (public and private) require a form of electronic identification (e-identity) to log in. This is used for various purposes, including accessing government services, banking, healthcare, and more.

The most common forms of e-identity in Sweden are either BankID or Freja eID+.

## BankID

BankID is the most widely used e-identity in Sweden. It is issued by banks and can be used for online banking, government services, and many other applications. Most online services started allowing login exclusively with BankID (e.g. Telia).
To get BankID, you need to have a bank account with a Swedish bank. The process varies between banks but generally involves visiting a branch in person to verify your identity and then setting up BankID on your computer or mobile device (see [banks](/docs/info/daily-life/banks) for more information on how to setup an account).

The main requirement for BankID is to have a Swedish ID. Since you probably are not a Swedish citizen, you need Skatteverket's ID card (see [ID Card](/docs/info/move-to-sweden/id-card)).

## Freja eID+

Freja eID+ (or just Freja+) is the second most used e-identity in Sweden. Unfortunately, not all services support it, and some only support BankID.
To get Freja eID+, you need to delete your existing basic Freja eID you used to notify Skatteverket and re-register using your Swedish *personnummer* and
Skatteverket's ID card ([ID Card](/docs/info/move-to-sweden/id-card) for more information).

Once the process is complete, you will have a new basic Freja eID that you have to upgrade to Freja eID+.
The upgrade process starts in the app (follow the prompts) and requires a physical visit to a service point to verify your identity since Skatteverket's ID card lacks NFC capabilities. The app will show the available service points but the closest in the area is "Rud post och spel" inside the Pekås supermarket.
Ask the staff at the service point to help you with the verification process.

After 3 hours from the verification, your Freja eID will be upgraded to Freja eID+. You will receive a notification in the app when the process is complete.
