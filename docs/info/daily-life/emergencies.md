# Emergencies

In case of an emergency, you can call the emergency number **112** for police, fire brigade, or ambulance services. This number is free of charge and can be dialed from any phone, including mobile phones. The service is available 24/7, and operators can assist you in multiple languages, including English.

The population is alerted in case of emergencies via radio, television broadcasts, and sirens. It is important to stay informed and follow the instructions provided by the authorities during such situations. You can download the SVT (Sveriges Television) app and/or SR (Sveriges Radio) app on your phone to receive emergency alerts and updates as notifications. The apps are available for both iOS and Android devices (see [useful apps](/docs/info/daily-life/useful-apps)).

## Protection rooms

In case of a severe emergency, such as a natural disaster or military conflict, you may need to seek shelter in one of the many protection rooms (*skyddsrum*). These rooms are designed to provide safety and protection from various threats. During periods of peace, these rooms are often used as storage spaces or for other purposes.

Buildings that are equipped with protection rooms are clearly marked with a sign above the entrance. The sign is a blue triangle in a yellow square with the word *"SKYDDSRUM"* below in black.

## Emergency System Test

Every city in Sweden is equipped with a siren system that can be used to alert the population in case of an emergency. The sirens are tested
every 3 months on the first Monday at 15:00 (3 PM) with a sound that lasts at least 7 seconds, followed by another sound that "cancels" the alert.
