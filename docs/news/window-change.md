# Window change 2026

:::note
The large white poster attached in the main lobby of each building.
:::

In the first quarter of 2026, all windows in the buildings will be replaced with new ones. There will be heavy machinery
throughout the area, and the work is expected to cause noise and dust.

Each apartment will be affected for 3-5 days, during which the windows will be removed and hazardous materials such as
asbestos and PCB will be handled according to regulations. During this time, the windows will be sealed of and you will
not be able to open them. You **do not** need to vacate your apartment nor be present.

The new windows will be equipped with triple glazing, ventilation function and built-in blinds.

Before your building is scheduled for window replacement, you will receive a pamphlet in the mail with more information and
instructions on how to prepare your apartment for the work.
