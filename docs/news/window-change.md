The windows in our buildings will be replaced during 2026. Each apartment will be affected for 3-5 days.

During this time, the windows will be sealed of and you will
not be able to open them. You **do not** need to vacate your apartment.

The new windows will be equipped with triple glazing, ventilation function and built-in blinds.

Starting on January 7, the windows in the buildings located at Horsensgatan 2-48
will be replaced, starting from Horsensgatan 46. The work is expected to be done
for all buildings by July 26.

During the preliminary checks, PCB and asbestos were found in some of the windows.
Sanitation of these hazardous materials will be done according to regulations during
the window replacement.

As a tenant, you will receive a letter before starting the work in your apartment.
Information will be sent out around 1 month before and again 1 week before the work starts.

During the work, heavy machinery and other vehicles will be present in the area.
For your safety, try to keep a safe distance from the work area.
